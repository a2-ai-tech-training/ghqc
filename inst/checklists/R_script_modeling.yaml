"R script - modeling in R focus":
  - "Preamble exists accoring to Section 4.1.3 Layout in the Analysis and Reporting Guidance - Metworx v1.2"
  - "Seeds are set correctly throughout the script to provide reproducible simulations, samplings, manipulations, outputs, etc."
  - "All sourced files are included in the QC log and are individually QCed."
  - "Any input directories, models, datasets, or other objects are correct"
  - "Any output directories, files, or other objects are correct"
  - "Functions, calculations, manipulations, and summaries, etc. reflect the intent of the analysis. I.e. quantiles and percentiles are correct according to the intended confidence interval."
  - "All datasets, tables, figures, listings and other outputted objects are reproducible."
  - "All outputted figures, tables, listings, etc. are created using the MSToolsGSK functions that include an audit trail in the footnotes."
  - "All outputted figures in files (e.g. PDFs, PNGs, etc) are printed with legible font, axes, etc.; are not running outside of the figure margins, and contain audit trail as created by MSToolsGSK functions."
  - "Model structures are written correctly to reflect intended model."
  - "Correct functions are used for intended modeling."
  - "There is no hardcoding throughout the script; sources for any values that must be hard coded are recorded as comments in the script."
