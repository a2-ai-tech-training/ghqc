"R script - VPC focus":
  - "Preamble exists accoring to Section 4.1.3 Layout in the Analysis and Reporting Guidance - Metworx v1.2."
  - "Seeds are set correctly throughout the script to provide reproducible simulations, samplings, manipulations, outputs, etc."
  - "All sourced files are included in the QC log and are individually QCed."
  - "Any input directories, models, datasets, or other objects are correct."
  - "Any output directories, files, or other objects are correct."
  - "Functions, calculations, manipulations, and summaries, etc. reflect the intent of the analysis. I.e. quantiles and percentiles are correct according to the intended confidence interval."
  - "All datasets, tables, figures, listings and other outputted objects are reproducible."
  - "All outputted figures, tables, listings, etc. are created using the MSToolsGSK functions that include an audit trail in the footnotes."
  - "VPC summary statistics are calculated correctly for observed and simulated data."
  - "Handling of BLQ data is performed as the analyst intended, i.e: simulations performed into the full dataset including at times of BLQ records, observed BLQ records are set as LLOQ/2 or dropped from summary, etc."
  - "A validated function or method is used for creating the VPC plot."
  - "There is no hardcoding throughout the script; sources for any values that must be hard coded are recorded as comments in the script."
