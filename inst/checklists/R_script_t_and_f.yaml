"R script - T&F focus (EDA, GOF diagnostics, post-processing for NCA outputs, any other T&F)":
  - Preamble exists accoring to Section 4.1.3 Layout in the Analysis and Reporting Guidance - Metworx v1.2.
  - Seeds are set correctly throughout the script to provide reproducible simulations, samplings, manipulations, outputs, etc.
  - All sourced files are included in the QC log and are individually QCed.
  - Any input directories, models, datasets, or other objects are correct
  - Any output directories, files, or other objects are correct.
  - Functions, calculations, manipulations, and summaries, etc. reflect the intent of the analysis. I.e. quantiles and percentiles are correct according to the intended confidence interval.
  - All datasets, tables, figures, listings and other outputted objects are reproducible.
  - All outputted figures, tables, listings, etc. are created using the MSToolsGSK functions that include an audit trail in the footnotes.
  - All outputted figures in files (e.g. PDFs, PNGs, etc) are printed with legible font, axes, etc.; are not running outside of the figure margins, and contain audit trail as created by MSToolsGSK functions.
  - There is no hardcoding throughout the script; sources for any values that must be hard coded are recorded as comments in the script.
