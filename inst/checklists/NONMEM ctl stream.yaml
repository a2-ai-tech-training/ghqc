"NONMEM ctl stream":
- '$PROB: run number and description are suitable'
- '$DATA: dataset and IGNORE statement are correct'
- '$INPUT: order of variable names match dataset and DROP implemented correctly'
- ADVAN and TRANS selections reflect correct model
- Parameters (THETA, ETA, SIGMA) are numbered and used correctly
- Scale value corresponds to sampling compartment and is scaled correctly
- Log transformations are appropriately applied
- Derivations are performed correctly, e.g. AUC.
- If $PRED used, equations are defined correctly
- If $PK is used, required model parameters are defined correctly
- If $DES is used, compartments and differential equations are defined correctly.
- If performing $SIM, the correct MSF file is used or parameters are fixed from the
  correct final model.
- In .lst output, model converged without critical errors
