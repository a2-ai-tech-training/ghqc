NCA:
  Set-up:
  - Correct dataset used. Any modifications appropriate and documented.
  - Exclusion of anomalous concentration appropriate (if applicable).
  - Correct units for time and concentration variable specified. Use CDISC SDTM Controlled Terminology UNIT. If dataset (WATSON) may not apply.
  - Any negative pre-dose times set to zero (only if applicable)
  - Filtered for ‘ANL03L’ to include ‘Y’ if ANL03L column (only if present in dataset).
  NCA:
  - Source data mapped correctly.
  - Time and concentration variables mapped correctly.
  - Model type selected appropriately (dependent of route of administration).
  - Dosing set-up appropriately includes unit.
  - Partial areas named and included appropriately (if applicable). Use CDISC SDTM Controlled Terminology PKPARMCD and suffix with the time interval in parentheses; e.g. AUCINT(0-12) if dataset was generated by Biostatistics e.g. (DOMINO). If dataset (WATSON) may not apply.
  - Calculation method for area under the curve (AUC) is assigned as linear up/logarithmic down (unless otherwise specified with rationale).
  - Weighting is assigned as uniform (unless otherwise specified with rationale).
  - Points for regression slopes selected appropriately. See considerations in slope selection for determination of lambda_z and associated parameters row of this checklist. If dataset (WATSON) may not apply.
  - Associated PK parameters are output/included in workbook (if applicable). E.g. TLST associated AUCLST; AUCPEO associated to AUCINF; AUMCINF associated to AUMCPEO; LAMZ, LAMZLL, LAMZUL and R2 associated with LAMZHL. If dataset (WATSON) may not apply.
  Outputs:
  - Final Parameters (_param.csv), Summary Table (_summ.csv) and Dosing (_dosing.csv) files named appropriately. E.g. Name_param.csv, where Name is the Dataset filename.
  - ND and NC assignment done correctly. If dataset (WATSON) may not apply.
  Tables / Figures:
  - Units correctly assigned.
  - Figure axes names and legends assigned correctly.
  - Data summary correct (e.g. by ID, analyte, matrix, day, dose, sex, etc.).
  - Correct summary statistics included (typically N, Geometric mean, gCV%, median, range).
  Considerations in slope selection for determination of LAMZ and associated parameters:
  - "A minimum of three points are to be included in the slope determination; the reliability of lambda_z and associated parameters should also be considered as follows:  \n1) Linear regression of logarithmically transformed concentration versus time data will be used for slope determination. \n2) Only those data points judged to describe the terminal log-linear decline will be used in the regression. \n3) The duration of time over which lambda_z is estimated should be at least 2 times the subsequently estimated terminal phase half-life (t1/2) to be reliably estimated. Deviation from this is acceptable if clearly documented. \n4) The associated regression coefficient (r2) should be ³ 0.85. Deviation from this is acceptable if clearly documented. \n5) The percentage of AUC(0-inf) obtained by extrapolation should be < 20%. Deviation from this is acceptable if clearly documented and at least 80% of the profiles in the study have <20% of the AUC(0-inf) as extrapolated area. It is unacceptable to use AUC(0-inf) data if >40% of the AUC(0-inf) has been extrapolated, except in specific situations which should be carefully justified."
