"mrgsolve model":
- Model is based off of correct NONMEM model
- Parameter estimates using either $NMXML, $NMEXT, or $PARAM are from correct model
- Model code is translated correctly from NONMEM
- Covariates are implemented correctly, typically using the reference groups as the
  covariate parameter value in $PARAM
- Scaling and concentration calculation is correctly performed (e.g. S2 = V2/1000;
  IPRED = CENT/S2)
