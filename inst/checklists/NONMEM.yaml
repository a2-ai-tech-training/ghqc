"NONMEM control streams ($EST or $SIM) (both .mod and .ctl)":
  - $PROB decription corresponds to current run number and model description.
  - $DATA uses the correct dataset.
  - $INPUT reflects the correct order of variable names consistent with the dataset and uses DROP appropriately for character columns.
  - ADVAN and TRANS selections reflect model purpose and parameterisation.
  - Model parameters (e.g. THETA, ETA, SIGMA) are numbered correctly and used consistently.
  - The scale value corresponds to the sampling compartment volume e.g. S2=V2, S2=V2/1000.
  - Log transformations are appropriately applied.
  - Derivations are performed correctly, e.g. AUC.
  - If $PRED used, equations are defined correctly including link between independent and dependent variables.
  - If $PK is used, required PK model parameters and inter-individual variance models are defined correctly.
  - If $DES is used, all compartments and differential equations are defined correctly.
  - If performing $SIM, the correct MSF file is used or parameters are fixed from the correct final model.
  - Model ran without critical errors.
